        <h2>Balancing Rock</h2>
        <p>Balancing Rocks in Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh, is a sheer geological marvel in the true sense. Located on the way to the Madan Mahal Fort, which was built by Raja Madan Singh, a Gond ruler, Balancing Rocks is a rocky formation of uneven rocks, which is said to be created by volcanic eruptions thousands of years ago. The archaeologists and geologists fail to sight the exact reason stating how these rocks could stay unmoved for so many years.</p>

        <h2>Dhuadhaar Fall</h2>
        <p>The Dhuandhar Falls are located on the Narmada River in Bhedaghat and are 30 meters high. The Narmada River, making its way through the world-famous Marble Rocks, narrows down and then plunges into a waterfall known as Dhuandhar. The plunge, which creates a bouncing mass of mist, is so powerful that its roar can be heard from a far distance.
            The best time to visit Dhuandhar Falls is during Sharad Purnima, when Narmada Mahotsava is celebrated. The white marble rocks appear spectacular when the moonlight falls on them, rendering them a silvery appearance. Boating is available at Dhuandhar Falls.</p>
